# Natural_Language_Processing_Nanodegree


This repository contains all the Natural Language Processing projects I worked on while finishing [Udacity NLP Nanodegree program](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/KYLUPRNY). I worked on projects like machine translation, speech recognition, Attention model, speech tagging etc.


## Projects

* [Attention](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Natural_Language_Processing_Nanodegree/blob/main/Attention%20Basics.ipynb): Implemented Attention model using matrix multiplication.
* [Machine Translation](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/master/Dog_Breed_Classifier_CNN): Here, I built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. It accepts English text as input and return the French translation.
* [Speech Tagging](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/master/TV_Script_generation_RNN):  Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis (for example, dis-count as a noun vs dis-count as a verb), for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguation. I used the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset. Hidden Markov models are used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision,etc..
* [Voice User Interfaces](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/master/Face_Generation_GAN): Here, I built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! It accepts raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language.
